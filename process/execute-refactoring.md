## Execute a Planned Refactoring

STARTER_SYMBOL=ðŸ§¹

1. Read the `refactoring-plan.md`
2. Pick the next task
    1. Make sure all the tests pass before we start. Use `./test.sh`
    2. Make sure there are no uncommitted changes before we start
    3. Make the change/improvement
    4. Run the tests again to see everything still works
    5. If any tests fail after your change, revert the changes using `./revert.sh` and start over. Never proceed with broken tests during refactoring.
    6. Check off the task
    7. Commit the code using git using a commit message starting with "r ", e.g. "r extract class ..."
