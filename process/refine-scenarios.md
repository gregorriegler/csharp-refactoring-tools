# Refine a Scenario

STARTER_SYMBOL=üìù

1. Read `README.md` and `goal.md` to understand what we are working on.
2. Pick the first DRAFT Scenario
3. Come up with a list of examples for this particular scenario, starting with the simplest case you can think of. Sometimes it makes sense to use Zero/One/Many to find really simple ones. Think about inputs and outputs. What information would the user have to input to the system, and what would they want to get out of it? The first example should be just enough for us to build a walking skeleton. The examples will later be used as a testlist in the TDD process. Add those examples to `goal.md` as a todo list to the scenario we are working on. Each item should be unchecked. They should be ordered by simplicity ascending.
4. Stop. Let me review the examples. When I say it's ok, you can continue.
5. Change the scenario status from "- DRAFT" to "- REFINED"
6. Commit the changes using a message prefixed with "d refined ..."
7. End the process by starting a new context with the prompt "Read the `process/development-process.md` and apply it.
