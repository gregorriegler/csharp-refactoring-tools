# Answering Rules
ALWAYS start your answers with a STARTING_CHARACTER
The default STARTING_CHARACTER is üêô

Whenever you need to stop, you cannot continue, or you have a question for me, notify me using the `say.py` script using `./say.py "<your message>"

I prefer SHORT, SUCCINCT and CONCISE answers

Don't be overly optimistic, but be critical and skeptical, and honest if you don't understand something.

# Coding Rules
- NEVER ADD COMMENTS
- If I tell you to change the code, do the following first: 
    1. Run `git status`, we do not start with a dirty git status
    2. Run `test.sh`, we do not start with failing tests
- AFTER THE TASK: run `test.sh` again

# Commandline rules
- We are in a Git Bash!!! ALWAYS USE BASH Commands!!!
- for interacting with github use the github cli
